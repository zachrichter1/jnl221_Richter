		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these projects:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/" target="_blank">Data breach hacks</a>, Information Is Beautiful</li>
			<li><a href="https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/" target="_blank">Hip hop vocabulary</a>, The Pudding</li>
			<li><a href="https://drones.pitchinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Drones dropped in Pakistan</a>, Pitch Interactive</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-7464500a-6368-4029-aa41-ab94e0ee09fb" target="_blank">COVID deaths through sound</a>, BBC</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? What do you think is the key message of this dataviz project? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>

		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>

		<h3>Choose from one of these projects:</h3>

		<h3>COVID deaths through sound<h3>
			<p>The majority of the data in this project is from John Hopkins University. The exceptions are data from China and any data before January 22nd is from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Also, government data is used for the UK and France. Automatic animation charts are used to show the change in COVID-19 cases and deaths.<p>
			<p>The key message of this dataviz project is that the COVID-19 has greatly affected the entire world however has affected some continents and countries even more than others. This dataviz project is effective at conveying it’s new message because it doesn’t just have an animation for the world or each continent, it goes into depth and shows how specifically each country was individually affected. It is also effective because the animations use sound that increases in intensity with the worsening of the pandemic.</p>
			<p>I believe this project is visceral because the pandemic is a grim, depressing thing that has personally affected almost every single person in some form. Many has lost loved ones or know someone who has lost a loved one. It has also changed the way in which we go about our daily lives.</p>
