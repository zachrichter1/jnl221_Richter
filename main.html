	<h1>Freak storm lashes NYC area with dime-sized hail, possible tornado</h1>

	<h2>A severe thunderstorm swept across the New York Metro area Saturday, dropping dime-sized hail across the five boroughs and sending a possible tornado across Long Island.</h2>

	<p>
		Wind gusts up to 50 mph knocked down trees throughout the region, including one that blocked traffic on the Long Island Expressway at the Douglaston Parkway. At least two more fell on subway tracks, on the Q like at Avenue M in Brooklyn and the A line in Far Rockaway.
	</p>
	<p>
		In Midtown, an apparent gust sent something flying off the roof of a building that hit a streetlight, sending it crashing into an MTA bus on West 54th Street near 10th Avenue. No serious injuries were immediately reported.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The National Weather Service <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSNewYorkNY/status/1459610372567015426">issued a tornado warning for parts of Long Island</a> as the thick black clouds moved across Nassau County. On social media, weather buffs pointed to indications on radar that appeared to show a tornado moving through from Hewlett to Levittown, the area where the warning was up.	
	</p>

	<p>
		Accuweather meteorologist Isaac Longley said there were no confirmed reports of a tornado touching down in either county yet – they can sometimes take several days or longer for weather experts to confirm – but he did see “two areas of rotation” in central Long Island on his radar.
	</p>

	<p>
		“This is really a nasty line of storms just pushing across Long Island,” he said.
	</p>

	<p>
		Hail was reported from Tottenville on Staten Island to Woodlawn in the Bronx, and across the Hudson Valley and New Jersey. In Mahwah, ABC-7 reported the ice <a href="https://twitter.com/ABC7NY/status/1459604116691464197">started to accumulate</a> in small drifts.
	</p>

	<p>
		The unusual weather will continue for the next few days. Overnight, temperatures are expected to drop into the 30s, with gusty winds continuing.
	</p>

	<p>
		Sunday, temps are expected to reach only 50, a far cry from the springlike weather the region has seen in the past week but closer to the normal 55 degrees for this part of November, Longley said.

	<p>
		The chill will remain Monday and Tuesday. Parts of Northern New Jersey and the Hudson Valley could see some snow mixed in with a cold rain.
	</p>

	<p>
		By Wednesday, there will be a notable change and temperatures will again return to the upper 50s, Longley said, adding, “It’s a little bit of a rollercoaster ride this week.”
